Larger projects, or those that implement a lot of custom build logic, may require you to take a deeper look into the build process to find bottlenecks. You can do that by profiling how long Gradle takes to execute each phase of the build lifecycle and each build task. For example, if your build profile shows that Gradle is spending too much time configuring your project, it may suggest that you need to [move custom build logic out of the configuration phase](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/optimize-your-build#optimize_configuration). Additionally, if the `mergeDevDebugResources` task consumes a large amount of the build time, it may indicate that you need to either [convert your images to WebP](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/optimize-your-build#use_webp) or [disable PNG crunching](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/optimize-your-build#disable_crunching).

If you're using Android Studio 4.0 or higher, the best way to investigate build performance issues is by [using the Build Analyzer](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-analyzer).

In addition, there are two options for profiling your build outside of Android Studio:

1.  The standalone [`gradle-profiler` tool](#gradle-profiler), a robust tool for deep analysis of your build.

2.  The Gradle [`--profile` option](#gradle-profile-option), a convenient tool available from the Gradle command line.

## Using the standalone `gradle-profiler` tool

In order to find the project setup that provides you with the best build speed, you should use [Gradle profiler](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler), a tool for gathering profiling and benchmarking information for Gradle builds. Gradle profiler allows you to create build scenarios and run them multiple times, preventing high variance between results and ensuring reproducibility of the results.

[Benchmarking mode](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler#benchmarking-a-build) should be used to collect information about clean and incremental builds, while [profiling mode](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler#profiling-a-build) can be used to collect more granular information about the runs, including CPU snapshots.

Some of the project setup configurations for benchmarking include:

*   Plugin versions
*   Gradle versions
*   JVM settings (heap size, permgen size, garbage collection, etc.)
*   Number of Gradle workers (`org.gradle.workers.max`)
*   Per\-plugin options to further optimize performance

### Getting started

*   Install gradle\-profiler by following [these instructions](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler#installing)
*   Run: `gradle-profiler --benchmark --project-dir <root-project> :app:assembleDebug`

This will benchmark a fully up\-to\-date build because `--benchmark` runs the task multiple times without changing the project in between. Then it will generate an HTML report under the `profile-out/` directory showing you the build times.

There are other scenarios that may be more useful to benchmark:

*   Code changes in a method body in a class where you do most of your work.
*   API changes in a module that's used throughout your project. While less frequent than changes to your own code, this has a bigger impact and it's useful to measure it.
*   Layout edits to simulate iterating on UI work.
*   String edits to simulate dealing with translation work.
*   Clean builds to simulate changes to the build itself (e.g., Android Gradle plugin update, Gradle update, or edits to your own build code under `buildSrc`).

In order to benchmark these use cases, you can create a scenario that will be used to drive the `gradle-profiler` execution and which applies appropriate changes to your sources. You can examine some of the common scenarios below.

**Note:** Depending on a variety of factors, Gradle profiler may take a long time to complete. These factors include the size of your codebase and the type of build you're running – for example, a clean build generally takes longer than other operations.

### Profiling different memory/CPU settings

In order to benchmark different memory and CPU settings, you can create multiple scenarios which use different values for `org.gradle.jvmargs`. For example, you can create scenarios:

```
# <root-project>/scenarios.txtclean_build_2gb_4workers {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    gradle-args = ["--max-workers=4"]    jvm-args = ["-Xmx2048m"]    cleanup-tasks = ["clean"]}clean_build_parallelGC {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    jvm-args = ["-XX:+UseParallelGC"]    cleanup-tasks = ["clean"]}clean_build_G1GC_4gb {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    jvm-args = ["-Xmx4096m", "-XX:+UseG1GC"]    cleanup-tasks = ["clean"]}
```

Running `gradle-profiler --benchmark --project-dir <root-project> --scenario-file scenarios.txt` will run three scenarios, and you'll be able to compare how long `:app:assembleDebug` takes for each of these setups.

### Profiling different Gradle plugin versions

In order to find out how changing the version of the Gradle plugin impacts build times, create a scenario for benchmarking that. This requires some preparation to make the plugin version injectable from the scenario. Change your root build.gradle:

```
# <root-project>/build.gradlebuildscript {    def agpVersion = providers.systemProperty("agpVersion").forUseAtConfigurationTime().orNull ?: '4.1.0'    ext.kotlin = providers.systemProperty('kotlinVersion').forUseAtConfigurationTime().orNull ?: '1.4.0'    dependencies {        classpath "com.android.tools.build:gradle:$agpVersion"        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin"    }}
```

Now you can specify the Android Gradle plugin and Kotlin Gradle plugin versions from the scenarios file, and have the scenario add a new method to the source files:

```
# <root-project>/scenarios.txtnon_abi_change_agp4.1.0_kotlin1.4.10 {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    apply-abi-change-to ["app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.java,                              "app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.kt"]    System-properties {      "agpVersion" = "4.1.0"      "kotlinVersion" = "1.4.10"}non_abi_change_agp4.2.0_kotlin1.4.20 {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    apply-abi-change-to ["app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.java,                              "app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.kt"]    System-properties {      "agpVersion" = "4.2.0-alpha16"      "kotlinVersion" = "1.4.20"}
```

### Profiling an incremental build

The majority of builds are incremental, making this one of the most important scenarios to profile. Gradle profiler has extensive support for [profiling incremental builds](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler#profiling-incremental-builds). It is able to apply changes to a source file automatically by changing a method body, adding a new method, or changing a layout or string resource. For instance, you can create incremental scenarios like this:

```
# <root-project>/scenarios.txtnon_abi_change {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    apply-non-abi-change-to = ["app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.java,                              "app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.kt"]}abi_change {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    apply-abi-change-to = ["app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.java,                              "app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.kt"]}layout_change {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    apply-android-layout-change-to = "app/src/main/res/your_layout_file.xml"}string_resource_change {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    apply-android-resource-value-change-to = "app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml"}
```

Running `gradle-profiler --benchmark --project-dir &lt;root-project> --scenario-file scenarios.txt` will generate the HTML report with the benchmarking data.

You can combine incremental scenarios with other settings, like heap size, number of workers, or Gradle version:

```
# <root-project>/scenarios.txtnon_abi_change_4g {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    apply-non-abi-change-to ["app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.java,                              "app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.kt"]    jvm-args = ["-Xmx4096m"]}non_abi_change_4g_8workers {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    apply-non-abi-change-to ["app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.java,                              "app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.kt"]    jvm-args = ["-Xmx4096m"]    gradle-args = ["--max-workers=8"]}non_abi_change_3g_gradle67 {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    apply-non-abi-change-to ["app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.java,                              "app/src/main/java/com/example/your_app/your_code_file.kt"]    jvm-args = ["-Xmx3072m"]    version = ["6.7"]}
```

### Profiling a clean build

In order to benchmark a clean build, you can create a scenario that will be used to drive the gradle\-profiler execution:

```
# <root-project>/scenarios.txtclean_build {    tasks = [":app:assembleDebug"]    cleanup-tasks = ["clean"]}
```

To run this scenario, use the following command:

```
gradle-profiler --benchmark --project-dir <root-project> --scenario-file scenarios.txt
```

## Using the Gradle `--profile` option

To generate and view a build profile from the Gradle command line, perform the following steps:

1.  Open a command\-line terminal at the root of your project.
2.  Perform a clean build by entering the following command. As you profile your build, you should perform a clean build between each build you profile because Gradle skips tasks when inputs to a task (such as source code) don't change. Thus, a second build with no input changes always runs faster because tasks are not being re\-run. So running the `clean` task between your builds ensures that you profile the full build process.// On Mac or Linux, run the Gradle wrapper using "./gradlew".
    gradlew clean
3.  Execute a debug build of one of your product flavors, such as the "dev" flavor, with the following flags:gradlew \-\-profile \-\-offline \-\-rerun\-tasks assembleFlavorDebug
    *   `--profile`: Enables profiling.
    *   `--offline`: Disables Gradle from fetching online dependencies. This makes sure than any delays caused by Gradle attempting to update your dependencies don't interfere with your profiling data. You should have already built your project once to make sure Gradle has already downloaded and cached your dependencies.
    *   `--rerun-tasks`: Forces Gradle to rerun all tasks and ignore any task optimizations.

    After the build completes, use the **Project** window navigate to the `project-root/build/reports/profile/` directory (as shown in figure 1).

5.  Right\-click the `profile-timestamp.html` file and select **Open in Browser > Default**. The report should look similar to the one shown in figure 2. You can inspect each tab in the report to learn about your build, such as the **Task Execution** tab which shows how long Gradle took to execute each build task.

6.  **Optional:** Before making any changes to your project or build configuration, repeat the command in step 3, but omit the `--rerun-tasks` flag. Because Gradle attempts to save time by not re\-executing tasks whose inputs haven't changed (these are indicated as `UP-TO-DATE` in the **Task Execution** tab of the report, as shown in figure 3), you can identify which tasks are performing work when they shouldn't be. For example, if the `:app:processDevUniversalDebugManifest` is not marked as `UP-TO-DATE`, it may suggest that your build configuration is dynamically updating the manifest with every build. However, some tasks need to run during each build, such as `:app:checkDevDebugManifest`.

Now that you have a build profile report, you can begin looking for optimization opportunities by inspecting the information in each tab of the report. Some build settings require experimentation because the benefits may differ between projects and workstations. For example, projects with a large codebase may benefit from [code shrinking](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code) to remove unused code and shrink the APK size. However, smaller projects may benefit more from disabling code shrinking altogether. Additionally, increasing the Gradle heap size (using [`org.gradle.jvmargs`](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html)) might negatively impact performance on low\-memory machines.

After making a change to your build configuration, observe the results of your changes by repeating the steps above and generating a new build profile. For example, figure 4 shows a report for the same sample app after applying some of the basic optimizations described in this page.
