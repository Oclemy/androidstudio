[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) is a mobile platform that helps you quickly develop high\-quality apps, grow your user base, and earn more money. Firebase is made up of complementary features that you can mix\-and\-match to fit your needs, with [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/) at the core. You can explore and integrate Firebase services in your app directly from Android Studio using the **Assistant** window shown in figure 1.

First make sure you have installed Google Repository version 26 or higher, using the following steps:

1.  Click **Tools > SDK Manager**.
2.  Click the **SDK Tools** tab.
3.  Check the **Google Repository** checkbox, and click **OK**.
4.  Click **OK** to install.
5.  Click **Background** to complete the installation in the background, or wait for the installation to complete and click **Finish**.

You can now open and use the **Assistant** window in Android Studio by following these steps:

1.  Click **Tools > Firebase** to open the **Assistant** window.
2.  Click to expand one of the listed features (for example, Analytics), then click the **Get Started** tutorial to connect to Firebase and add the necessary code to your app.
