# Comparison of Android Emulator tools

The following table compares the tasks you can perform using the [emulator UI](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator), AVD Manager, commonly used [command\-line startup options](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-commandline#startup-options), and the [Emulator Console](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-console). In the AVD Manager, you can set [hardware profile](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#hpproperties) and [AVD](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds#avdproperties) properties.

The table compares features that are similar, but not necessarily with identical functionality, between different emulator tools.

Although not listed in the table, the adb utility also supports commands for interacting with virtual devices, as described in [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb). For example, you can install an app on a virtual device by using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#runningapp), the [emulator UI](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#tasks), or [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#move). You can copy a file to a virtual device using the emulator UI or [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#copyfiles), and copy a file from a virtual device using adb.

Remember that to use certain features of the emulator with your apps, you need to enable them through various [`<uses-feature>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element) elements and [manifest permission](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission) constants, just as you would if you ran them on a hardware device.
