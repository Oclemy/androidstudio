The Translations Editor provides a consolidated and editable view of all of your default and translated [string resources](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource).

For an introduction to translating your app for different languages, read [Supporting different languages and cultures](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/languages).

## String resources

The string resources for a project are contained in `strings.xml` files. Your project has a default `strings.xml` file that contains string resources in the default language for your app, which is the language you expect most of your app users to speak. You can also have translated `strings.xml` files that contain string resources for other languages that you want your app to accommodate.

Once you have your default `strings.xml` file completed, you can add the translations yourself, or pay a professional service to do the translations. Either way, you should take advantage of the Android Studio features to help you [manage and test localizable text](#localize). For information about professional translation services, see [Order translation services](#ordering).

## Open the Translations Editor

You can access the Translations Editor from the following places in Android Studio.

### Open from the Android view

1.  In the **Project > Android** panel on the left, select **ModuleName > res > values**.
2.  Right\-click the **strings.xml** file, and select **Open Translations Editor**.

    The Translations Editor displays the key and value pairs from the `strings.xml` file.

    **Note:** When you have translated `strings.xml` files, your project has multiple corresponding **values** folders with suffixes that indicate the language, such as **values\-es** for Spanish. Your default `strings.xml` file is always in the **values** (no suffix) folder.

Figure 1 shows the default app text (in this case, English) in the Translations Editor for a simple app before translation work has been done. The contents of translated `strings.xml` files will appear to the right of the **Untranslatable** column with one column per language as shown in figure 2.

### Open from within strings.xml

You can access the **Translations Editor** from within any of your `strings.xml` files.

1.  In the **Project > Android** panel on the left, select **ModuleName > res > values**.
2.  Double\-click **strings.xml** to open it for editing.
3.  In **strings.xml**, click the **Open editor** link in the upper\-right corner.

**Note:** If you click the **Hide notification** link, the **Open editor** link goes away. To bring it back, close and reopen the project.

### Open from the Design Editor

You can open the **Translations Editor** from the Layout Editor's Design Editor to edit your default and translated text to better fit your layout. For information about switching languages in the Design Editor, see [Display translated text in the Design Editor](#view).

1.  In the **Project > Android** panel on the left, select **ModuleName > res > layout**.
2.  Double\-click **content\_main.xml** to open it for editing.
3.  Click the **Design** tab in the lower\-left corner to display the **Design** Editor.
4.  In the Design Editor, select the **Language** ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/buttons/layout-editor-language-icon.png) drop\-down list.
5.  Select **Edit Translations** ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/buttons/translations-edit-icon.png).

## Configure untranslatable rows

In the **Translations Editor**, you can select **Unstranslatable** to indicate that you do not want the text in this row to be translated. Text that you would not want translated might be product\-specific text like trade names and trade marks, or technical terms that do not have a translation.

When you check **Untranslatable**, the corresponding line in the default `strings.xml` file adds **translatable="false"**. In the following example, **EasyApp** in the top line is not translated because it is the product name.

<resources> <string  name\="app\_name"  translatable\="false"\>EasyApp</string> <string  name\="action\_settings"\>Settings</string> <string  name\="easy\_app"\>I am a Simple App!</string> <string  name\="next\_page"\>Next Page</string> <string  name\="second\_page\_message"\>I am the Second Page!</string> <string  name\="title\_activity\_second"\>SecondActivity</string>
</resources>

## Add and delete languages

The **Translations Editor** supports [BCP 47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) and combines locale and region (country) codes into a single selection for targeted localizations. A locale defines more than the language. A locale includes country\-dependent formatting for things like the date and time, currencies, and decimals.

To add a language, do the following:

1.  In the **Translations Editor**, click the globe icon ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/buttons/translations-edit-icon.png).
2.  From the drop\-down list, select the language you want to add.

    The new language appears in the **Translations Editor**, and a **values\-\*** folder with a `strings.xml` file is added to the project. For example, **values\-es** for Spanish.

To delete a language, do the following:

You can delete a language in the **Translations Editor** by deleting every value in the column (see [Edit, add, or delete text](#editaddtext)), or you can delete the project folder for that language, as follows:

1.  In the **Project > Android** panel on the left, select **ModuleName > res**.
2.  Right click the **values\-\*** folder for the language you want to delete. For example, **values\-hi** for Hindi.
3.  From the drop\-down list, select **Delete** to delete the folder and its **strings.xml** file.

## Edit, add, and delete text

You can operate on the text settings directly in the `strings.xml` file or through the **Translations Editor**. This section describes the **Translations Editor** approach. In the **Translations Editor**, you can edit, add, or delete text through the list view or through the **Translation** field at the bottom of the **Translations Editor**.

![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/write/translation-field_2x.png)

**Figure 2.** List view on the top and the **Translation** field on the bottom

#### List view

To edit or add text, do the following:

1.  Double\-click the cell where you want to edit or add text.
2.  Do a keyboard copy\-paste, or if you have a keyboard that supports diacritic marks, type directly into the list view.
3.  **Tab** or move the cursor out of the field.

To delete text, do the following:

1.  Double\-click the cell you want to delete.
2.  In the list view, select the text and press **Delete**.
3.  **Tab** or move the cursor out of the field.

#### Translation field

To edit or add text, do the following:

1.  In the list view, single\-click the cell where you want to edit or add text.
2.  In the **Translation** field, do a keyboard copy\-paste, or if you have a keyboard that supports diacritic marks, type directly into the **Translation** field.
3.  **Tab** or move the cursor out of the field.

To delete text, do the following:

1.  Single\-click the cell you want to delete.
2.  In the **Translation** field, select the text and press **Delete**.

## Add and delete keys

In the Translations Editor, the **Key** column lists the unique identifiers for each data item in your `strings.xml` files. You can add and delete keys through the Translations Editor. When you delete a key, the Translations Editor deletes it and all of its associated translations. The Translations Editor uses the Safe Delete refactoring to delete a key so you know if the key text is used elsewhere and have a chance to make necessary adjustments before you delete the key. The Safe Delete refatoring ensures that your code still compiles after you delete the key.

To add a key, do the following:

1.  In the **Translations Editor**, click **Add Key** ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/buttons/add-sign-green-icon.png).
2.  In the dialog, enter a key name, default value, and the location of the default **strings.xml** file. ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/write/addkey_2x.png)

    **Figure 3.** Add a key

To delete a key, do the following:

1.  In the Translations Editor, select the key you want to delete.
2.  Click **Remove Keys** ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/buttons/ic_minus.png).
3.  In the **Delete** dialog, decide if you want a safe delete and whether you want to search in comments and strings, and click **OK**.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/write/translations-editor-delete-dialog_2x.png)

    **Figure 4.** Delete dialog

    If there are no references (usages) to the deleted key, or if all references are safely collapsible, the key is deleted. Otherwise, the Translations Editor displays the **Usages Detected** dialog with information about the problems detected.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/write/translations-editor-usages-detected_2x.png)

    **Figure 5.** Delete dialog

4.  Select **View Usages** to review what will be deleted. The **Find Safe Delete Conflicts** dialog shows all of the usages that are not safe to delete so you can edit your corresponding code. ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/write/translations-editor-delete-key_2x.png)

    **Figure 6.** Unsafe usages

5.  Right\-click a usage to display the context menu and select **Jump to Source** so you can make the needed changes.
6.  In the **Find Safe Delete Conflicts** panel, select **Rerun Safe Delete** to make sure there are no other usages that need attention.
7.  When the usages are cleaned up, click **Do Refactor** to delete the key.

## Correct errors

Figure 7 shows the **Translations Editor** displaying the contents of the English, Spanish, and French `strings.xml` files. The red text indicates lines that have errors.

![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/write/translations-editor_2x.png)

**Figure 7.** Red text indicates an error condition that you must fix

To correct an error, hover over the red text to display an explanation of the problem and its resolution.

When you make changes in the **Translations Editor**, the underlying `strings.xml` files update with your changes. When you make changes in a `strings.xml` file, the corresponding column in the **Translations Editor** updates with your changes.

Example **Translations Editor** corrections:

*   Figure 7 shows that the **app\_name** row has **Untranslatable** checked, but there is a Spanish translation provided. Delete the Spanish translation to correct the error.
*   Figure 7 shows that the **next\_page** row is missing a French translation. Use your keyboard to copy **Page Suivante** into the cell to correct the error. A keyboard copy\-paste operation copies the text with the diacritic marks into the cell.

## Display translated text in the Design Editor

To see how the translated text displays in your app layout, toggle the text between the default and translated versions in the Design Editor, as follows:

1.  In the **Project > Android** panel on the left, select **ModuleName > res > layout**.
2.  Double\-click **content\_main.xml** to open it for editing.
3.  Click the **Design** tab in the lower\-left corner to display the **Design** Editor.
4.  In the Design Editor, select the **Language** ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/buttons/layout-editor-language-icon.png) drop\-down list.
5.  Select **Edit Translations** ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/buttons/translations-edit-icon.png).
6.  Select the language you want to use to view your app.

    ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/write/spanish-language_2x.png)

    **Figure 8.** The language drop\-down list with Spanish selected

The Design Editor displays your app layout in the selected language, which in this case is Spanish.

## Manage and test localizable text

The Android platform and Android Studio provide several features to help you manage and test your localizable app text. These features have options to help you target issues with right\-to\-left (RTL) scripts, such as Arabic or Hebrew. Testing your localizable text allows you to make adjustments to the UI text and its layout before you commit your messages to the source repository to be sent for translation later.

### Refactor your project for RTL support

Android Studio has a refactoring command that enables support for bidirectional text in [`TextView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView), [`ConstraintLayout`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintLayout), and [`LinearLayout`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/LinearLayout) elements so your apps can display and allow users to edit text in both left\-to\-right (LTR) and right\-to\-left (RTL) scripts. The command also provides automatic mirroring of app UI layouts and all view widgets. To see the text direction change and the layout mirroring, you must also set the [text and layout direction properties](#direction) in the [Layout Editor](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/layout-editor.html).

The following procedure shows how to refactor your project for RTL support:

1.  Select **Refactor > Add RTL support where possible** to display the dialog shown in figure 11. ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/write/localize-add-rtl-support_2x.png)

    **Figure 11.** Add RTL support

    *   If the `<application>` element in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file does not have the `android:supportsRTL="true"` attribute, then select the **Update AndroidManifest.xml** checkbox.
    *   If your app's `targetSdkVersion` is 17 or higher, select **Replace Left/Right Properties with Start/End Properties**. In this case, your properties should use "start" and "end" instead of "left" and "right". For example, `android:paddingLeft` becomes `android:paddingStart`.
    *   If your app's `targetSdkVersion` is 16 or less, select **Generate \-v17 Versions** In this case, your XML should use both sets of properties. For example, your XML should use both `android:paddingLeft` and `android:paddingStart`.
2.  To display the **Find Refactoring Preview** window, click **Run**. ![](https://developer.android.com/studio/images/write/localize-find-refactor-preview_2x.png)

    **Figure 12.** Check the preview

3.  Click **Do Refactor**.

For more information about refactoring your project for RTL support, see [Native RTL support in Android 4.2](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2013/03/native-rtl-support-in-android-42.html).

### Text and layout direction properties

The Properties window on the right provides the **textDirection** property to use with text widgets and the **layoutDirection** property to use with layout widgets to change the direction of text and layout components. The direction properties are listed in the **Properties** window on the right, and work with API Level 17 or higher.

To see the text direction change and the layout mirroring, you must also [refactor](#refactor) the project for RTL support. In English, the text direction change moves only punctuation from the right side to the left side of the text; for example, "Hello World!" becomes "!Hello World". To see LTR text switch to RTL, you have to use an RTL language in your app. If you want to use English and see the text switch to RTL for testing purposes, use [pseudolocales](#pseudolocales). Pseudolocales are independent of the refactoring command and the direction properties.

To access and use the direction properties, do the following:

1.  In the [Layout Editor](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/layout-editor#intro), select a text widget.
2.  Open the **Properties** window and search for the RTL property you want to use.

    To set the property value, select one of the following:

    *   **firstStrong:** Default for the root view. The first strong directional character determines the paragraph direction. If there is no strong directional character, the paragraph direction is the view's resolved layout direction.
    *   **anyRtl:** The paragraph direction is RTL if it contains any strong RTL character; otherwise, it is LTR if it contains any strong LTR characters. If there are neither, the paragraph direction is the view's resolved layout direction.
    *   **ltr:** The paragraph direction is LTR.
    *   **rtl:** The paragraph direction is RTL.
    *   **locale:** The paragraph direction comes from the system locale.
    *   **inherit:** Default. Use the direction set in the parent.

    **Note:** Strong directional characters have their own predefined direction, such as most alphabetic and syllabic characters, non\-European and non\-Arabic digits, Han ideographs, and punctuation characters that are specific to only those scripts.

3.  To review the reversed text and layout, run the app.

### Pseudolocales

A pseudolocale is a simulated locale that is designed to assume the characteristics of languages that cause UI, layout, RTL, and other translation problems when an app is translated. Pseudolocales provide instant and automatic translations that are readable in English for all localizable messages. This makes it possible for you to catch untranslatable messages in your source code.

For information about how to use pseudolocales, see [Test Your App with Pseudolocales](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/pseudolocales).
